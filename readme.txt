This notebook presents a Python Monte Carlo prototype to price a simplified equity autocallable structured product (Phoenix type).
The goal of this project is mainly educational, to better understand how autocall payoffs work and how Monte Carlo pricing can be applied to structured products.

The focus is on clarity and intuition rather than on having a fully realistic desk model.
